## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is *Corey Townsend*, hope you are doing great! 
Currently, I am working as an **Automation Test Engineer**

In the future, I want to work in Cloud Development.

I have two sausage dogs; Ron and Merlin, they drive me mad.

I love playing Tennis, Rock Climbing and playing video games (currently playing Kingdom Come Delivernace I)
